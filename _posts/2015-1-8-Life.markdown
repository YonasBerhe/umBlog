Life… So, here are my goals in these next 10,000 days:

1) Learn something new everyday, and use it in someway.

2)Friends — Be around positive people always

3) Family — I want to be around them, love them, support them, hug and kiss them.

4) Friends — I want to support them, embellish them, promote them, confide in them, count on them.

5) Legacy — I must do something that lasts well after these next 10,000 days.

So at the end of every week now, I’m asking myself the following:

1) How many days did I do the things above?

2) How many days did I just give into the norm vs push back? Fight back…

3) How many days was I happy? Like, really happy. Not fake, cosmetic happy.

4) How many days did I give up what I really wanted because someone else’s marginal validation tricked me from focusing on the bigger picture?
