- Sketching is the process of rapidly translating ideas into something tangible


Sketching allows us to us to:

- To explore
- To Refine
- To simplify the complex
- To Validate
- To communicate visually
- To save time


Story boarding is to tell a story about the users
interaction with your product visually.

Why should we Storyboard?

Look at user activities at an even higher level ‣Consider parts of the experience that don’t involve the system

‣“John comes home from work exhausted from a long day”

‣“Nancy tells her friends about how easy it was”

 ‣Storytelling depicts the user experience in an emotional way

What is an interface?

The means through which people interact with a machine.
